Needs Work list:

1. plot a day
  - currently using a slow way to get data into lat/lon (needs to be vectorized)
    - try using np.flatten 

2. scrape all
  - make this smarter, cleaner
    - would a class work better?


5. subset and concatenate
  - can I make it optional to pass a list of files instead of using glob.glob?
  - lists of files would work in more settings
    - could a class be used to maintain these lists between function calls?

6. restructure flowmod to be object oriented
  - Idea: use downloading script as generic downloder with multiple default templates
    - make flowMod object oriented and store optimal sensors and SSMI/S in class
      - should allow for cleaning up of scrape_all
  a) there should be a class member list of 19H files and 37H file_setup
  b) need sensor dictionary to be a class member
  c) class getters for getting proper sensor for the proper year

Object oriented notes:
- what is initialized in the __init__?
  - The user could enter their date range and lat/long
    - then the __init__ just initializes

- the class should have lists for the files that have been subsetted
  - then i can use those lists to concatenate and such
  - hopefully no globbing needed
