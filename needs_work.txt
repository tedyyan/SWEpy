Needs Work list:


NewList:
1. Add way for users to pass login information through scrape and scrape_all

2. remove my default username and password, in favor of looking for the .netrc file

3. Fix plot_a_day
    - it is integrated into the class, but not showing any data
    - want to speed up the building of the dataframe
    - first fix missing visible data on maps




Testing Order:
1. make new conda env with yml file
2. install swepy via pip
3. install ipykernel spec and open jupyter tqdm_notebook
4. attempt to instantiate the class
5. call the scape_all function

Things to check functionality:
1. do scrape and scrape all allow user entered username and password??
2. any way to use conda-forge for dependencies?
3. is my package installable with conda? 



Cleanup Notes:
1. Downloader done

2.  don't need the full_workflow files anymore
  - move them to hold for now
