Needs Work list:


NewList:
1. Add way for users to pass login information through scrape and scrape_all

2. remove my default username and password, in favor of looking for the .netrc file



1. plot a day
  - currently using a slow way to get data into lat/lon (needs to be vectorized)
    - try using np.flatten

2. scrape all



5. subset and concatenate


6. restructure flowmod to be object oriented
  - Idea: use downloading script as generic downloder with multiple default templates
    - make flowMod object oriented and store optimal sensors and SSMI/S in class
      - should allow for cleaning up of scrape_all
  a) there should be a class member list of 19H files and 37H file_setup
  b) need sensor dictionary to be a class member
  c) class getters for getting proper sensor for the proper year

Object oriented notes:
- what is initialized in the __init__?
  - The user could enter their date range and lat/long
    - then the __init__ just initializes

- the class should have lists for the files that have been subsetted
  - then i can use those lists to concatenate and such
  - hopefully no globbing needed



Class:
- instantiated with date range, working directory, and lat/lon bounding box
- at that point, class knows the date range to build, user can call scrape_all or call the functions independently
  - what if they want to enter the date range later?



How to Mesh nsidcDownloader for use with individual use of sewpy functionality?
  - scrape function? User inputs information they want to specify, and wrapper
    function handles setting up the file



Testing Order:
1. make new conda env with yml file
2. install swepy via pip
3. install ipykernel spec and open jupyter tqdm_notebook
4. attempt to instantiate the class
5. call the scape_all function

Things to check functionality:
1. do scrape and scrape all allow user entered username and password??
2. make sure dependencies are properly installed
    - eliminate need for yml file 



Cleanup Notes:
1. Downloader done

2.  don't need the full_workflow files anymore
  - move them to hold for now
