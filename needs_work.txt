Needs Work list:


NewList:
1. remove my default username and password, in favor of looking for the .netrc file

2. test swepy with M grid (between -40 and 40)

3. Figure out what to do with the 'edge cases'

3. Fix plot_a_day
    - it is integrated into the class, but not showing any data
    - want to speed up the building of the dataframe
    - first fix missing visible data on maps




Testing Order:
1. make new conda env with yml file
2. install swepy via pip
3. install ipykernel spec and open jupyter tqdm_notebook
4. attempt to instantiate the class
5. call the scape_all function

Things to check functionality:
2. any way to use conda-forge for dependencies?
3. package not installable with conda yet



Cleanup Notes:
1. Downloader done

2.  don't need the full_workflow files anymore
  - move them to hold for now
  -


Current Bugs:



New Instatiation Idea:
- Need to add ability for user to choose coords in the M and S Hemi
  - Need to either:
    1. automatically use the entered coords to determine which region to use (do this one)
    2. have user enter that (nahhhh)

- Automagically determine which hemi to use based on the coordinates
  - border lats are +- 67 deg




plot a day not working:
- always displaying data in a weird spot in alaska, regardless of ul, lr lat lon coordinates
- seems shifted to the left....
  - seems to be the correct projection
  - correct lat/lon conversion




Orientation of the bounding box:
- oriented with the prime meridian (in north grid)
- still trying to figure out the southern grid
  - no orientation seems to work properly!!!
