Needs Work list:

1. plot a day
  - currently using a slow way to get data into lat/lon (needs to be vectorized)
  -

2. scrape all
  - doing all of the file path building
  - make this smarter, cleaner
    - would a class work better?
  - the code should be cleaner in general
    - get rid of stray iterables, switch to enumerate

3. nsidcDownloader
  - working pretty well
  - figure out how to automate SSMI/S inside scraper
    - somehow in the class method?
  - also automate the sensor by year inside the scraper

4. get_xy
  - decide if we need to do 3.125 and 6.25
  - simplify function if we only need one

5. subset and concatenate
  - can I make it optional to pass a list of files instead of using glob.glob?
  - lists of files would work in more settings
    - could a class be used to maintain these lists between function calls?
