Welcome to SWEpy's documentation!
=================================

SWEpy is a Python library designed to simplify access to a passive microwave
brightness temperature dataset available at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).
This dataset contains Northern and Southern hemisphere imagery along with Equatorial imagery,
and can be quite useful in analyzing snow water equivalent (SWE) over large spatial extents.
SWEpy contains tools to web scrape, geographically subset, and concatenate files into time cubes.
SWEpy also contains tools to aid in the initial processing of passive microwave data into proxy SWE information.
