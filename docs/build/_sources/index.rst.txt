Welcome to swepy's documentation!
=================================

SWEpy is a Python library designed to simplify access to a passive
microwave brightness temperature dataset available at the National
Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). This dataset contains Northern and
Southern hemisphere imagery along with Equatorial imagery, and can be
quite useful in analyzing snow water equivalent (SWE) over large spatial extents.
SWEpy contains tools to web scrape, geographically subset, and concatenate files
into time cubes. SWEpy also contains tools to aid in the initial processing of
passive microwave data into proxy SWE information
