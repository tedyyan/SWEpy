## Note:

I will be uploading data to google drive and share that with you guys. I need to go back and re-download the optimal sensors for years 2013-2016

The goals of this project are in development. We have daily SWE data from 1990 - 2016 for the arctic. My initial ideas involve comparing overall trends in SWE in different areas of the arctic, although there are lots of things we could do with this data

## Things we can focus on:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \text{Develop Open Source Workflow}

I think there is some potential for developing an open source workflow for web-scraping and subsetting netCDF files, maybe even with some kind of interface. 

\item{Focus on Analysis and Development of Neural Net Framework}

There is so much room for analysis of this data. I have a basic LSTM Neural Net built out for this, but a more advanced conv-lstm would work better. I think it would be cool to create some interactive graphs of SWE over the years, and we can have the last frames be predictions instead of true data. 

\end{enumerate}
